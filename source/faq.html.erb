            <li>Community Engagement: Get involved in a programmer community such as Code Scouts, Ruby Newbies, Hack + Help, RailsGirls/RubyNest, JavaScript Admirers, or any of a hundred other options you can find on <a href="http://calagator.org/events">Calagator</a>.</li>

    <div class="question">
      <h4><a href="">Can I really learn to code in 12 weeks?</a></h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, but you should expect to work hard in this program (about 2-3 hours outside of class for each hour in class). Our programs each meet two nights weekly (3 hours each night), and one Saturday each month (6 hours more). We want to make sure you are prepared for a career as web developer, which means there is a lot of ground to cover.</p>
