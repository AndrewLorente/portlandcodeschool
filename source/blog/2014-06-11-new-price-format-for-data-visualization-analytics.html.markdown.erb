### We'll keep this short and sweet.

[Last month](/blog/2014-05-19-new-class-data-visualization-with-huston-hedinger.html), we told you about our new [Data Visualization & Analytics course](/datavisualization), taught by [Huston Hedinger](/meettheteam/#huston-hedinger.html), founder and CEO of GraphAlchemist. You told us that you loved the topic, but the class was too long and the price was too high!

Because of your feedback, we've ***lowered the price to $1295 and switched to an all-new Sunday lecture format.*** If you're an employee or member of one of our partner organizations, you'll get an additional $300 off!

Simply contact <%= mail_to "info@portlandcodeschool.com", "info@portlandcodeschool.com" %> to find out if your organization qualifies, and to start your enrollment now!
