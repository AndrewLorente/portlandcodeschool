  <h2>Careers at Portland Code School</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>Do you love to code AND love to teach?</p>

  <p>The thing that sets Portland Code School apart from online courses is our instructors and our classroom environment. Our instructors know that today's programming jobs require teamwork, collaboration, lifelong learning, and mad technical skills. Our instructors work hard to help our students discover and grow these skills in themselves.</p>

  <p>At the same time, our instructors are working freelance programmers and developers, keeping up to date with the latest technologies and keeping clients happy with exceptional results.

  <p>We are always on the lookout for that rare combination of programming experience and a passion for teaching.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Classroom teaching at the corporate or college level</li>
    <li>Programming, software engineering, or web application product development</li>
    <li>Front-end development, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, including experience with popular libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Mobile development, including jQuery-mobile, PhoneGap/Cordova, iOS, Android, etc.</li>
    <li>Server-side application development in JavaScript, Ruby, or Python and experience with web application frameworks like Rails</li>
    <li>Instructional design and curriculum development</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What you do that Portland code school will depend on the level of experience you bring and the kind of work you'd like to do. We have opportunities for:</p>
