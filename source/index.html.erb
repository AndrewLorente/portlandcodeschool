        Learn to build interactive and dynamic web applications using Ruby on Rails. We start with a one month intensive on Ruby. After that, you start building your portfolio - command line scripts, database utilities, web applications -- and take a deep dive into the Rails framework, culminating with a capstone project that you'll be proud to show employers. We emphasize team-oriented, project based practice so that you'll have both the people skills and technical chops you need.
