  Here's what our students are saying about Portland Code School:

      "I attended the part-time, evening Javascript class while working full-time.  It can be done!  While it is entirely possible to learn on one's own, the community at PCS is what really seals the deal.  The contacts I made and the people I got to know helped me with every step of my journey.  I believe my road to employment as a developer would have included significantly more wrong turns and dead ends had I not enrolled at PCS. It would have taken me a lot longer to transition into a new career that I love!""

      "My experience in the JavaScript Immersion course was tremendous.  It is an intense program, but the instructors are extremely knowledgeable and they and all the other PCS staff are incredibly supportive.  I accepted a paid internship offer through PCSâ€™s employer network only three weeks after graduating.  I would definitely recommend the JavaScript Immersion course for anyone interested in building the skills to become a junior software developer.""

      "Enrolling in the Portland Code School was a significant commitment for me living an hour outside of Portland. Now employed as a full-time developer, in retrospect, I wish I had done it sooner. My experience in the Full-Stack JavaScript course was a complete blend of skill development, portfolio building, and networking within the Portland coding community.The enthusiastic team at PCS exposed us to every opportunity to jump start our careers. I consider the Portland Code School a great opportunity for those who desire to be a developer or any professional looking to learn a new discipline.""

<!-- <div class="row">

  <p>Our curriculum is designed to take talented, motivated people from zero skills to engaged, challenging employment, whether they want to work from home as freelancers or they want to join a high-tech company as a full-time developer. Our programs are not easy - they take lots of work, dedication, study, and effort over a relatively short period of time. But we have a track record of placing nearly all of our students in interesting, lucrative web development positions.</p>

  <p>All PCS classes employ a broad spectrum of teaching methods: screencasts, online interactive training, instructor-led discussions and design workshops, and team-oriented project-based programming activities. PCS maintains an open classroom where students can congregate at any time of the day to work on projects, do homework, or interact with instructor/mentors. PCS instructors and students support and participate in local development community activities.</p>

  <p>PCS cultivates an employer network of high-technology software development companies, placement companies, and employment agencies who provide time, people, and resources to help PCS students learn state-of-the-art skills and find internships, temporary contracts, and entry-level jobs.</p>
