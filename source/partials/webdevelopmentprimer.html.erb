  <p>
    Get your very first taste of tech! This <%= link_to "two part program", "http://portlandcodeschool.github.io/primer" %> is for people who are ready to explore the field of web development and learn some of the industry standard skills and tools.
  </p>  
  <p>
    Take the Primer Basic to get your toes wet, or take the whole series to springboard farther into the exciting world of code!
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primer Basic</strong> - In the first class you will learn the very basics of building websites in a fun, collaborative environment using HTML, CSS and GitHub. This class assumes students have little or no experience with web technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Primer Pro</strong> - Diving deeper, the Primer Pro helps you understand the world of coding as a professional web developer. Create interactive and responsive websites for small businesses that work on either a desktop or a smart phone using advanced tools such as JavaScript/jQuery and Bootstrap. Students also get the opportunity to experience an exclusive tour of one of Portland's leading tech companies. Moreover, the skills learned in this series prepares students for any of our advanced classes (such as Full Stack JavaScript).</li>
