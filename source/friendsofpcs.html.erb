<h2>Friends of PCS</h2>

<p>
  Portland Code School's students, staff, and instructors want to celebrate all the individual, community, and employer partners that help us learn, grow, and create great new developers. Friends of PCS get first access to new graduates and discounts on class tuition for themselves or their teams.

<h3>Don't see your company here?</h3>
<p>
  If you know you've helped us out, but don't see your name or logo here, it doesn't mean we're not friends! We wanted to make extra sure we had your say so before announcing you here, so we're reaching out to everyone individually. Lucky us, there are a lot of you! Feel free to <%= mail_to "info@portlandcodeschool.com", "contact us" %> so we can include you right away!
