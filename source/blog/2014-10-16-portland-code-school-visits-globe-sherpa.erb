One of the best things about being a student at Portland Code School is getting guided in figuring out where you should land. By the time you sign up for school, you've probably decided that you want to work in tech, but WHERE in tech might be a little more confusing. Fortunately, at PCS, every couple weeks, you'll get to do a walking tour of some great places to work and maybe even make some connections for a new job. 

This week, we visited Globe Sherpa, the team responsible for the TriMet ticket app.

Globe Sherpa has about 22 people on staff currently and the team works out of a sweet office with a great view in downtown Portland. On our walking tour there, we talked with Skip, who heads up most of the development. Several of us had seen Skip's talk at the Node JS Meetup back in September, which took place at Urban Airship, so we were already familiar with the team's switch from Drupal to Node and the great satisfaction they have had with that switch. Skip introduced us to some of the staff and fielded questions from students. Most memorable thing from the day? Smiles and eye contact from all the employees, even the ones sitting at their desks working. Wow, good job, Globe Sherpa.
