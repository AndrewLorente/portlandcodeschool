        "I attended the part-time, evening Javascript class while working full-time.  It can be done!  While it is entirely possible to learn on one's own, the community at PCS is what really seals the deal.  The contacts I made and the people I got to know helped me with every step of my journey.  I believe my road to employment as a developer would have included significantly more wrong turns and dead ends had I not enrolled at PCS. It would have taken me a lot longer to transition into a new career that I love!""

It is an intense program, but the instructors are extremely knowledgeable and they and all the other PCS staff are incredibly supportive.  I accepted a paid internship offer through PCS’s employer network only three weeks after graduating.  I would definitely recommend the JavaScript Immersion course for anyone interested in building the skills to become a junior software developer.""

I consider the Portland Code School a great opportunity for those who desire to be a developer or any professional looking to learn a new discipline.""
