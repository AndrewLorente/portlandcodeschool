### Learn Data Visualization with D3, Leaflet, Coffeescript, and Yeoman

Portland Code School is expanding our course offerings to help existing developers enhance their career. What better topic to start with than data visualization?

Check out the [course description:](/datavisualization/)

> Data visualization is a dynamic and emerging field which knits together concepts
> from software engineering, mathematics, user experience, and design. Part art,
> part science, with implications in the private, government, and non-profit
> sectors, data visualization leverages its cross-domain origins to to boil down
> complex concepts into simple, easily communicated and easily understood
> information.
>
> This 16 week course will focus on functional programming skills and techniques
> needed to create and deploy web based data visualizations. Technologies covered
> in this course include d3.js, leaflet.js, coffeescript, yeoman for modern
> workflows, as well as SVG.

Are you a new or experienced developer, or a designer looking to expand your JavaScript toolset with beautiful visualizations?
