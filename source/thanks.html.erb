<h3 class="thanks">Erica Lauer Vose</h3>

<h3 class="thanks">Omid Rahmat</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Burnside Digital</strong><br>
  Omid was the first financial backer, and the first business analyst to help us on our path. He was there to give us seed money to get started, and he was there to make sure we were on track to be off of investment funds as soon as possible. And even above that, he's dealt with all the legal paperwork to get the program running.
</p>

<h3 class="thanks">Bill Siebold</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Art Institute</strong><br>
  Bill was a constant source of inspiration and sound judgement for us in the formation of the program. His experience in tech education and his drive to see the program succeed was unendingly inspiring and helpful. He was the initial sounding board, and the voice of reason, when there were so many voices to listen to.
</p>

<h3 class="thanks">Hal Newton</h3>
<p>
  <strong>PageMutant / WholeBrain</strong><br>
  Hal was a godsend at the late stages of the first session by helping us coordinate and understand how to talk to CTOs and VPs at organizations that need to find great people. His words of wisdom, his network of peers, and his gentle guidance were brought to bear at exactly the right time.

<h3 class="thanks">Marc Charbonneau, Patrick Curtain, Victor Christensen</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Burnside Digital</strong><br>
  Everyone at Burnside Digital was amazing, but these people stepped forward frequently and helped us through jams with either sweat or brainpower. One person can only do so much.

  <strong>Portland Code School</strong><br>
  The first group of students, the guinea pigs. I have no words for the depth of gratitude we have towards this trio and we love seeing them flourish in their new careers!
