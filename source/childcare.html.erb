<p>In partnership with Karen Beninati's WeVillage, parents in the Coders with Kids program will receive vouchers for childcare. These vouchers will provide some childcare at no additional cost to tuition.</p>

<p>WeVillage is a top-rated independent daycare facility with locations in Hillsboro and the Pearl. They operate with a convenient online reservation system, so parents will be able to redeem hourly vouchers and tailor a schedule that works for them. For more information about WeVillage, visit their web site at <%= link_to "http://www.wevillage.com", "http://www.wevillage.com" %></p>

  <li>Coders with Kids waives the WeVillage joining fee.</li>

  <li>Vouchers provide a pool of resources for you to draw from over the course of your class. Factors such as age of the child, or using benefits for multiple children can affect the total hours available. Please see the <%= link_to "full details", "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uz8qQQKG9o-KKhiSYA6_ALKbp0XCaiqUdLmPFgMcXWE" %> to see how many hours you are eligible for.
  </li>

  <li>If you exceed the total childcare hour cap, you pay the discounted Portland Code School rate for any additional hours.</li>

  <li>Please note that parents in the 12- or 16-week classes who elect to use the deposit payment plan option for their $1000 class deposit are eligible only for the discounted childcare rate, and not any free childcare hours.</li>
  </ul>
