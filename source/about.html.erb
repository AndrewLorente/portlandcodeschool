  <h2>About Portland Code School</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Portland Code School students learn from experienced programmers, develop the skills needed to join a leading tech company, and have direct access to a network of local companies interested in hiring new developers. In addition to learning the nuts and bolts of coding, we teach you to solve problems, work as part of a team, and communicate clearly with clients and peers.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will learn the basics through a variety of methods, including in person lessons, screencasts, and reading documentation. You will solidify your understanding and hone your teamwork skills with code challenges structured like real client specs. Pair programming with classmates will be an essential component of everything you do. By the end of the course, you will know how to work with others to create technical solutions, have a portfolio to show employers, and have honed your interview and business sense. For more information about the nitty gritty details, please see our <%= link_to "frequently asked questions", "/faq.html" %>, or <%= link_to "contact us", "/contact.html" %>.

  <h2>Our Mission: Quickly prepare talented, motivated people for jobs in web development</h2>
<hr />
  <%= link_to "Let us help you start a new career!", "/getinfo.html", :class=>"btn btn-default big-apply-button" %>
  <p>Our curriculum is designed to take talented, motivated people from zero skills to engaged, challenging employment, whether they want to work from home as freelancers or they want to join a high-tech company as a full-time developer. Our programs are not easy - they take lots of work, dedication, study, and effort over a relatively short period of time. But we have a track record of placing nearly all of our students in interesting, lucrative web development positions.</p>

  <p>All PCS classes employ a broad spectrum of teaching methods: screencasts, online interactive training, instructor-led discussions and design workshops, and team-oriented project-based programming activities. PCS maintains an open classroom where students can congregate at any time of the day to work on projects, do homework, or interact with instructor/mentors. PCS instructors and students support and participate in local development community activities.</p> 

  <p>PCS cultivates an employer network of high-technology software development companies, placement companies, and employment agencies who provide time, people, and resources to help PCS students learn state-of-the-art skills and find internships, temporary contracts, and entry-level jobs.</p>

  <h2>Our History</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
  Portland Code School launched its first class in September 2012, as an offshoot of development shop Burnside Digital, under the guidance of Chuck Lauer Vose, who saw a growing gap between the skills attainable through local colleges and the skills necessary to be a successful software developer in the business world. Since then, PCS has developed a broad curriculum of the most in-demand programming courses, and continues to place more than 90% of its graduates with employers throughout the area.
  </p>
  <p>
  We are indebted to a great many people for this success and would like to give <%= link_to "special thanks", "/thanks.html" %> for their help making this possible.
