Hi, I'm Ariel Spear. I'm a 23-year-old Junior Developer who just graduated from Portland Code School’s first ever JavaScript Immersion class this August and I’m pleased to announce…

## Portland Code School is having a [graduation party](http://pcs-showcase.eventbrite.com)!

The students from both my class and the evening class will be presenting our capstone projects. These are projects that exhibit all our recently developed skills. My group’s project was a web app promoting community sharing where users can post images and comments about items they wish to share and schedule meetings to physically exchange them.

I personally found it very fulfilling to take the skills we learned in class to make a real product. I know we're all really excited to be able to show off what we’ve done and meet our fellow developers.

The party will be held [at PCS](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1771+NW+Pettygrove+St,+Portland,+OR+97209/@45.5328923,-122.6892512,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x549509fcbffd67ef:0x285c5315ffa1e3cb) on ***August 27th from 6:30-8:30pm***. This is a great way to see what PCS graduates can do, get to know the school better and see some new upcoming talent in development. It should be a lot of fun, and I'm pretty excited. I hope I see you there.

**Note from PCS:** *Hope you enjoyed meeting Ariel! You can check out [her code on GitHub](https://github.com/arielspear), and get a sneak peek at her group's capstone project, [Swap-Tacular](https://github.com/arielspear/swap-tacular).*
