    <h4>Head Instructor</h4>
    <h4><%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", "/rubyonrails.html" %> and <%= link_to "Front End Freelancing", "/frontendfreelancing.html" %> Instructor</h4>

    <p>Al Zimmerman has 30 years of experience in software design, product development, information technology, and management. He has been teaching various aspects of software engineering and programming for over a dozen years to middle school students, college students, and professional engineers. He has experienced the joys of being on a tight-knit team of collaborators and wants to share that experience with his students.</p>

    <p>He is currently on a mission to increase diversity in the programming profession, having experienced the thrill of product development on teams composed of men, women, artists, engineers and scientists. "The best ideas come from all directions at once," he says.</p>

    <p>"More than anything," he says, "I love being in a classroom with talented, inquisitive people, helping them discover new things and achieve their career goals."</p>

    <p>In his spare time, Al is an improvisational comedy actor at Curious Comedy Theater where he finds that listening carefully, responding honestly, and laughing frequently is as useful on stage as it is in the classroom.</p>

    <p>
      Ním Wunnan lives and works in Portland, Oregon. During his seven year career in rare books, he researched, repaired, shipped, shelved, catalogued, and collated books and manuscripts from eight centuries including incunabula, a Gutenberg leaf, jeweled bindings, and horn books.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left book selling to study painting at the Glasgow School of Art, where he exhibited at Glasgow International before graduating with an honors degree in 2008. Since 2009, he has worked in web development as a developer, designer, and project manager. He is the founder and director of Research Club, a community-supported think tank which has gathered a diverse community of artists, fabricators, designers, developers, advocates, and writers while hosting events in Portland, Seattle, Berlin, London, and Glasgow. He has lectured at Pacific Northwest College of Art, Portland State University, Ignite, and Transmission Gallery (Glasgow). Much of his work is influenced by his severe synesthesia which is primarily sound > touch, sight > sound, and grapheme > color.

    <h4><%= link_to "JavaScript Immersion", "/javascriptimmersion.html" %> Instructor</h4>
    <p>
      Whitney Young has been a software developer and instructor for over 10 years. Before joining Portland Code School, he co-founded a software company in Chicago which focused on creating simple, intuitive, and useful Mac and iOS applications. During this time, he trained and built a strong team of engineers, re-discovering his passion for teaching. He is also responsible for creating a computer security course at his alma mater, where he honed his curriculum development and teaching skills. Throughout his career, Whitney has spoken at numerous technical conferences, served as a mentor for up-and-coming developers, and volunteered his time to teach programming to beginners. He has worked on complex back-end web architectures, highly custom native mobile apps, and everything in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitney has two strong beliefs about learning to code. First, and most important, is that anyone can learn to be a great developer. All that's required is a healthy dose of passion and the desire to tackle challenging problems. Second, coding is about clear communication with <i>other people</i>. The best software developers are able to clearly express their intent verbally, through writing, and through code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, Whitney has been learning Spanish and snowboarding. He's constantly humbled when listening to people switch flawlessly between languages or watching fearless young kids out on the slopes.

    <h4>Director</h4>
    <p>
      Cris comes to Portland Code School with 20 years of experience as an experiential educator and professional team builder. Adding programming and web development to his personal portfolio, he was one of the first graduates of Portland Code School and has gone on to be a driving force in building out the school as the premier educational resource in the area. A Portlander by way of Minnesota; California; and Ashland, Oregon, he is also a musician, game designer, rock climber, and father of one amazing boy (who insists on wearing his Spider Man pajamas to the store, and wants to be either a Firefighter or a Transformer when he grows up).

    <h3>Shawna Scott</h3>
    <h4>Assistant Director</h4>
    <p>
      Shawna is a graduate of Portland Code School's Ruby on Rails class. Her background is in education, activist organizing, and fine arts. Looking for community, Shawna began attending and then co-organizing Women Who Hack, a local user group for women in tech, at the urging of a friend. Even though she never thought of herself as technically inclined, she discovered that coding was not only fascinating, it could provide a career that would utilize both her critical thinking skills and creativity!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she's not coding or attending tech user groups, Shawna loves to spend time reading, throwing pottery, or relaxing with her wonderful wife, Tina, and their two furbabies, Mia the dog, and Quade the cat.
